Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point -
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.

your repo access and to practice PR'ing with your team _before_ you start
coding!

    > - **Backend:** Node, Express, Python/Django, Next.js server components
    > - **Helpful tools:** ShadUI, Supabase, Vitest, Redux Toolkit, Docker, Cypress/Playwright
    > - **Deployment:** Vercel, Render.com, Netlify.
    > - **Integrations:** Would be interested in any AI or ML integrations, but only if others are into the idea

    > Here’s a quick overview of my work availability and tech stack preferences:
    >
    > - **Availability:** I’m available full-time and tend to work better later in the day. Mornings can be a struggle, and I’m often up late.
    > - **Frontend:** I have a strong preference for TypeScript and React.
    > - **Backend:** I lean toward Node.js with TypeScript.
    > - **Helpful tools:** DaisyUI, RTK Query, and Playwright when they make sense, but I don’t consider them essential for every project.
    > - **Deployment:** Most of my recent personal projects use Netlify edge functions and Neon Postgres, mainly because they are free and easy to use. I’m not tied to this deployment strategy and am open to other options.
    > - **Integrations:** I’ve worked on payment workflows and external integrations and would be happy to explore more of that if it fits the project.
    > - **Industry trends:** AI and React Native with Expo are getting a lot of attention lately. I’m interested in exploring these more but would prefer to do so only if the team shares that enthusiasm, since I have less experience in those areas. Next.js is also very popular right now, and I’d be happy to use it for our project. If we do, I have a strong preference for the AppRouter over other routing strategies.
